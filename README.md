# Schema Change Notifier

This is a test repository for a GitHub action that notifies users on Slack whenever a push to the 'main' branch includes the creation of new .sql files.

It could get adjusted to notify user in any other way or triggered in other cases such as adding someone from data team as reviewer to a PR if the changes in a PR includes a new .sql file.
